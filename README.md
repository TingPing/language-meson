# Language Meson

Syntax highlighting for the [Meson](http://mesonbuild.com/) language.

## Note for other editors

Editors such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and TextMate can use the same
syntax highlighting but the CSON file must be converted to the TextMate format.

The easiest method to do so is via the Sublime Text [PackageDev](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/PackageDev)
package. Somebody could decouple the conversion [library](https://github.com/SublimeText/PackageDev/tree/master/plugins/lib/fileconv)
it uses to ease future conversion also. Example output is [here](https://gist.github.com/TingPing/02aea7422dacaded3a35a6ba12fc3757).
